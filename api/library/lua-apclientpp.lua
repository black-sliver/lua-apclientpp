-- Handlers --

---Callback will be called when the network connection was established.
---@param callback fun():nil
function APClient:set_socket_connected_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when connecting resulted in an error on network level.
---Sometimes errors are expected and APClient will automatically retry.
---Only use this for debugging and use timeout logic to detect actual connect errors.
---@param callback fun(reason:string):nil
function APClient:set_socket_error_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when the network connection was closed.
---@param callback fun():nil
function APClient:set_socket_disconnected_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when RoomInfo was received. Also use this to cancel any connect timeouts.
---@param callback fun():nil
function APClient:set_room_info_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when ConnectSlot succeeded.
---@param callback fun(slot_data:{[string]: any}):nil
function APClient:set_slot_connected_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when ConnectSlot failed.
---@param callback fun(reasons:string[]):nil
function APClient:set_slot_refused_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when items were received. Use item.index to see which are new.
---@param callback fun(items:NetworkItem[]):nil
function APClient:set_items_received_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when locations were scouted.
---@param callback fun(items:NetworkItem[]):nil
function APClient:set_location_info_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when locations were checked (e.g. a different player connected to the same slot).
---@param callback fun(locations:integer[]):nil
function APClient:set_location_checked_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when data package changed (was updated). Use is_data_package_valid to see if this was the final update.
---@param callback fun(data_package:{[string]: any}):nil
function APClient:set_data_package_changed_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when a legacy print message was received. This should not happen anymore.
---@param callback fun(message:string):nil
function APClient:set_print_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when a PrintJSON message was received.
---Use `render_json(data)` to get a human readable version.
---`command` is the complete command and can be used to filter messages.
---@param callback fun(data:{[string]: any}, command:{[string]: any}):nil
function APClient:set_print_json_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called when a Bounced message was received.
---@param callback fun(command:{[string]: any}):nil
function APClient:set_bounced_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called as response to Get.
---`data` is a table key -> value.
---`keys` is the list of keys. This is required because a `nil` value can't be checked for existence in data.
---`command` is the raw command including `extra`.
---@param callback fun(data:{[string]: any}, keys:string[], command:{[string]: any})
function APClient:set_retrieved_handler(callback) end

---Callback will be called as response to Set.
---@param callback fun(command:{[string]:any}):nil
